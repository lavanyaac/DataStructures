// A Thief has a knapsack that can hold X lbs of stolen goods
// Each stolen good is worth a certain amount of cash, but
// the stolen good also weighs a certain weight. This means that
// the thief has to pick an optimal combination of items!
// The Thief can't pick the same item twice.

// What is the maximum worth of goods that the thief can steal?

//Given:
//weight = [1,3,4,5]
//value = [1,4,5,7]
//total capacity = 7

//Solved by recursion

function knapsack_recursion(valueArr, weightArr, currCapacity, totalCapacity ){
	if(currCapacity >= )
